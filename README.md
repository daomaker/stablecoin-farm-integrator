# DAO Maker Stablecoin Farms referral system
## create your referrer id
Call function `setReferrer` with these parameters:
- an arbitrary id 8-chars long
- your address receiving fees
- fee on user APR (max 30%, the base is 100%, not APR) 

Contact us if you want to receive some fees also from DAO Maker's fees (~1% APR fee)

## refer users
Call function `deposit` with these parameters:
- amount to deposit
- your referral id (8-char long string)

## withdraw your fees
Users are charged fees when they withdraw (can be also done manually by calling `chargeFees` function). Part of their shares is redistributed to your fee receiving wallet. To withdraw them, simply call `withdraw` function.

## code examples
In this package there are included codes of deposit, withdraw and approve functions. You will probably need to modify it.
